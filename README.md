This is the capstone Blue Ocean project, created by a team of software engineers at Hack Reactor, in which we need to meet acceptance criteria determined by a client. It was a brief, 1-week sprint where our team focused on delivering an MVP by the delivery date.

The client requested the team to create a platform for bartering and exchanging goods and services, with no money involved.
